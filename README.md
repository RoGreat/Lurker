Mute servers and view which servers allow direct messages from the plugin's settings.

This allows you to quickly mute and unmute servers in one menu so you don't have to open the context menu a thousand times.

You can also view which servers have direct messages enabled. That way, you can decide if you want to disable direct messages for all servers and enable them for the servers that you actually care about. Spammers begone!
